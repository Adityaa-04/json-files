      "question": "Is this payment mode secure?",
      "answer": "Yes, this payment mode is very secure. The technology rides on Radio Frequency (RF) like a RFID tag but with more secure microprocessors which can perform cryptographic processing. The encryption technology used to send the transaction message is the same as the chip + PIN encryption. The maximum transaction value that can be processed by Tap only (without a PIN) is restricted to Rs 5,000, hence limiting your risk. The reserve bank of India, vide its circular has relaxed the requirement of Additional Factor of Authentication (AFA) in case of small value card present transactions using Near Field Communication (NFC). Contactless technology subject to adherence to EMV standards.",

      "question": "Can my transaction get triggered if I walk past the device?",
      "answer": "No, the contactless system is designed to give the card holder control. The vendor at the terminal needs to enter the purchase amount for approval and the card needs to be held near of the terminal for the transaction to occur. Also, terminals can process only one payment at a time. Each contactless transaction includes a unique code that changes with each purchase, which can only be used once and can only be generated by the chip in the original contactless card, preventing a counterfeit card from being produced from the intercepted card security details. In the unlikely event of fraud, you must notify us immediately or as soon as reasonably possible of any unauthorised card use or any suspicious activities.",

      "question": "How many contactless transactions can I do in a day?",
      "answer": "You can do 5 contactless transaction in a day, i.e. 5 transaction each of Rs. 5,000 without entering the PIN. Once the 5-transaction limit is hit, you will need to do a dip transaction and enter your PIN to complete the transaction. This is to limit the number of transaction that are done without the 2-factor authentication to 5. The transaction limit will be reset every day. The 5 transaction is set at a card level and not at a customer level.\n\nExample: if you have 2 contactless cards issued by Standard Chartered, you can do 5 contactless transaction on each card. This number is irrespective of the amount spent on the card in these 5 transactions.",
